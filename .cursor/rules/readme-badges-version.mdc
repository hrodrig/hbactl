# README badges and version

The main **README.md** must keep badges **in sync with the version in the Makefile** (`VERSION ?= x.y.z` at the top).

- When you **bump `VERSION`** in the Makefile, update any version badge or version text in the README to the same value (e.g. `v0.1.0` or `0.1.0`).
- Prefer a single source of truth: the Makefile defines the version; README badges and any "current version" text must reflect it.
- If using a dynamic badge (e.g. GitHub release/tag), ensure released tags match the Makefile version so the badge stays correct.
