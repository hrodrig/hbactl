# Language: code in English

All **code** in this repository must be in **English**:

- **Identifiers**: package, variable, function, type, and file names
- **Comments**: line and block comments in source files
- **Strings in code**: error messages, log text, CLI output, user-facing strings

Documentation (README, PLAN) and commit messages are recommended in English for a public repo but not enforced by this rule. Local notes (e.g. NOTES.txt) may stay in any language.
